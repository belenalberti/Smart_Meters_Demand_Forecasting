# Smart_Meters_Demand_Forecasting
The aim of this project was to build a neural network to forecast the energy demand for Londonâ€™s households using smart meter and weather data. 
The neural network built outperformed industry standard models by more than 30%. For this project I used Python with standard scientific computing 
libraries and Keras.
